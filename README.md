# Fork of SparsSorcerousSundries

This fork removes gibber fix that was added in TabletopTweaks-Base 2.6.16

Only use it if you already have original SparsSorcerousSundries installed, otherwise I discourage you from using it since it had no support from original author (or new maintaners) for years.

Otherwise my strong recommendation is to NOT USE THIS.
